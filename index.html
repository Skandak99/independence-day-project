(Around 1650's)

    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
        We Indians got Independence on 15 August 1947.
        After getting Independence,
         it took 2 years, 11 months, and 17 days to write the constitution.
         And after this we were considered fully independent.

    <hr>
<h4>
    Why did we need to get Independence in the first place?
</h4>
<p>
    The Britishers under the guise of trade the had come to India.
    Then slowly took over the country, mainly using "Divide and Rule"
     accompanied by corruption, bribery and blackmail.

       <li> The Battle of Plassey</li>
         <h6>
             This was the start of the British rule, from traders to rulers.
             This battle was fought by Siraj-ud-Daulah, and lost due to the betrayal of 
             one of his commanders. This was as Mir Jafar, the commander was promised the 
             the throne, bribed by the British.
         </h6>

             This was another war trying to get free from the British.

              Also, Raja Balwant Singh of Kashi, had made an alliance too!
              Even after that, they had lost the war.
        </h6>
      <li>  The Revolt of 1857</li>
        <h6>
            There were many causes, all of which were equally bad. 
            Though it had failed, this was considered as the "Great Uprising of 1857", 
            or the "Revolt of 1857". It is known as the "First War of Indian Independence".
